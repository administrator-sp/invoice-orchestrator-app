## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Upload to Your Company GitHub Repository

**Option A: Create New Repository (Recommended)**
1. Go to your company's GitHub organization
2. Click "New Repository"
3. Name: `invoice-orchestrator-app` (or similar)
4. Visibility: **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
5. Click "Create repository"

**Option B: Use Existing Repository**
1. Navigate to an existing company repository
2. Create a new folder: `/invoice-app/`
3. Upload files there

### 2. Upload These Files

Upload all files from this folder to your GitHub repository:
- `index.html`
- `disconnect.html`
- `EULA.md`
- `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
- `README.md`

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or master)
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
4. Click **Save**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### 4. Get Your URLs

After GitHub Pages is enabled, your URL will be:
```
https://YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/
```

For example:
- If your GitHub org is "subpop"
- And repo name is "invoice-orchestrator-app"
- Your URL is: `https://subpop.github.io/invoice-orchestrator-app/`

### 5. Fill in Intuit Developer Dashboard

Once GitHub Pages is live, use these URLs in Intuit:

```

**Launch URL:**
```
https://YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/
```

**Disconnect URL:**
